In-Out pattern defines two messages: an input message followed by an output message. The input message is labelled as "In" and has a direction of "in". The output message is labelled as "Out" and has a direction of "out". In-Out pattern needs a fault message in the "out" direction. The service provider may replace the output message by the fault message, if needed. This message exchange pattern is identified by the URI "http://www.w3.org/ns/wsdl/in-out"
